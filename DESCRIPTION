Description: 
    Provides tools for conducting conditional forecasts and scenario analysis 
    using vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Implements the Kalman filtering 
    methodology described in Clarida and Coyle (1984) and Banbura, Giannone, 
    and Lenza (2015), allowing users to impose constraints on future paths 
    of selected variables and simulate resulting forecast distributions.

# cforecast

**cforecast** is an R package for conducting conditional forecasts and scenario analysis using vector autoregressive (VAR) models. It implements the Kalman filtering methodology proposed by Clarida and Coyle (1984) and Banbura, Giannone, and Lenza (2015), allowing users to simulate forecast paths under imposed constraints on future values of selected variables.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub using:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("timginker/cforecast")
```


## Example

```{r message=FALSE}
library(cforecast)
library(vars)
library(ggplot2)

# Load data and fit VAR model
data(Canada)
fit <- VAR(Canada, p = 2, type = "const")

# Define a scenario: increase unemployment (4th variable) to 15 for 3 periods
cond_path <- matrix(rep(15, 3), ncol = 1)
cond_var <- 4

# Generate conditional forecast
conditional_forecast <- cforecast(fit = fit, cond_path = cond_path, cond_var = cond_var)

# Extract forecast and standard deviation
forecast <- conditional_forecast$forecast[, 1]
std_dev <- sqrt(conditional_forecast$mse[1, 1, ])
horizon <- length(forecast)
time <- seq_len(horizon)

df <- data.frame(
  Time = time,
  Forecast = forecast,
  Lower = forecast - 1.645 * std_dev,
  Upper = forecast + 1.645 * std_dev,
  Series = "Forecast"
)

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = Time, y = Forecast)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line(color = "black", linewidth = 0.6) +
  labs(
    x = "Horizon",
    y = "Forecasted Value",
    title = "Conditional Forecast with 90% Confidence Interval"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12, base_family = "serif") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  )

```
